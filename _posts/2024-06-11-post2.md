excerpt: "I updated and converted all comments related to AIO to Doxygen, and also fixed formatting in related source files."

Since I had already modified some Doxygen comments during previous work, my mentor suggested that I update and convert all comments related to AIO to Doxygen. This task was not particularly complex but rather time-consuming. I also took this opportunity to fix the formatting in all the related source files.

I encountered a few difficulties during this process, mainly due to the frequent back-and-forth reviews needed to correct small formatting errors I had missed. Additionally, I had some trouble getting Doxygen to work correctly. Some errors were related to the BSPs documentation, which was outside the scope of my project, so I filtered them out from the Doxygen build. However, I still couldn't see the changes I made in `aio.h`.

After some research, I discovered the issue was because the code was inside an `#ifdef` clause. When Doxygen built the documentation, the file was preprocessed, and since the macro wasn't defined, all my documentation was ignored. I considered different solutions, such as predefining the macro in the Doxyfile or changing the `#ifdef` clause to something like `#ifdef MACRO or DOXYGEN` and then predefining a DOXYGEN macro in the Doxyfile. Ultimately, I decided to disable preprocessing when building the documentation, allowing me to verify the changes I made.

Since I had updated the Doxygen documentation, I was also asked to update the API guide. For this, I partially reused the content I had written for the Doxygen documentation. This time, I had no problems building the documentation; following the instructions on the documentation page was sufficient.
