PROJECT SUMMARY

The Goal of my project was to improve the implementation of the Asynchronous Input outpout (AIO) interface in RTEMS. Prior to my contribution the implementation laked some functionalitieds and some methods did not adhere fully to the posix specifications. The plan for the project was divided in two parts, in the first half of the coding period my focus wouldf be centered around fixing the issue i found in the ewxisiting aio methods and by addressing the missing functionalities. In the second half the goal was to implement the two missing methods, particularly lio_listio() and aio_ssupend().
