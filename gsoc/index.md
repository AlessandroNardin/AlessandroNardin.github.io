## Project Abstract

The Posix Asynchronous I/O (AIO) Implementation project aims to enhance the compliance of the RTEMS real-time operating system with the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standards. By refining and completing the implementation of the Asynchronous I/O interface (AIO), the project seeks to improve the portability and flexibility of RTEMS, enabling developers to write applications that can be executed on various platforms.

## Project Scope

The project scope includes refining and completing the implementation of the Asynchronous I/O interface (AIO) in RTEMS. Currently, the implementation lacks some methods and functionalities. The project will focus on:

- Refactoring and completing the implementation of aio_fsync() and aio_return() methods.
- Implementing missing methods such as io_listio() and aio_suspend().
- Enhancing the AIO processing to improve readability and efficiency.

## Deliverables

### May 27 (coding begins)

- Setup for efficient coding and testing.
- Comprehensive understanding of the project area.
- Detailed plan for project execution.

### July 8 - 12 (Midterm Evaluation)

- Refactoring of AIO processing.
- Correcting deficiencies in existing methods.

### August 19 - 26 (Final Evaluation)

- Modification of message structure between aio_ functions and the server.
- Implementation of lio_listio() method.
- Implementation of aio_suspend() method.
- Testing to ensure correctness of implementations.

### August 31 (Final Results Announced)

- Documentation enhancement to cover all introduced features.

## Proposed Schedule

- **March 14 - March 24 (Application Period)**: Proposal drafting and submission.
- **March 26  - April 22 (Acceptance Waiting Period)**: Familiarization with RTEMS contribution process and filing of tickets for identified deficiencies.
- **April 23  - May 23 (Community Bonding Period)**: Project documentation and research.
- **May 24 - June 26 (First Half)**: Refactoring and correcting deficiencies in existing methods.
- **June 27 - August 23 (Second Half)**: Implementation of missing methods and testing.
- **August 31 (Final Results Announced)**: Documentation enhancement.
